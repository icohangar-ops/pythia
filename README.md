# Pythia

### A hardened multi-agent trading mesh for Gensyn's Delphi information markets

> *Pythia was the oracle at Delphi. In this system, no single model issues a prophecy — a mesh of specialized analyst agents must reach consensus before a trade is placed, and every step is human-auditable.*

**Protocol:** [Gensyn Delphi](https://docs.gensyn.ai/tech/agentic-trading) — on-chain information markets that generalize prediction markets to subjective and niche scenarios, with AI-as-arbiter settlement.

**Org:** [icohangar-ops / Impactquadrant](https://github.com/icohangar-ops) — *"Developer and enterprise infrastructure for building hardened, human-auditable multi-agent decision workflows."*

---

## Why Pythia

A single LLM prompted to trade prediction markets is structurally fragile: it over-weights recency, hallucinates market context, has no calibrated uncertainty, and cannot self-correct before placing a trade. Delphi specifically prices nuance and subjective scenarios — domains where ensemble reasoning and calibrated uncertainty beat raw news-speed. The `icohangar-ops` stack already solves the *hard* part: hardened, auditable, consensus-driven multi-agent decision workflows. Pythia is that stack with a thin Delphi adapter on top.

**The wedge:**
1. **Calibrated ensembles beat single-model punters** on subjective/niche markets — Delphi's differentiator vs. Polymarket.
2. **Agreement-gated trades** — only place a bet when the analyst mesh agrees beyond a threshold. Avoids the LLM-hallucination-blowup failure mode.
3. **Risk gates (`meshcfo`)** prevent ruin — staying solvent *is* alpha when the time horizon is short and the bankroll is finite.
4. **Replayable audit trail** — every decision is signed and replayable end-to-end, from analyst estimate to trade receipt.
5. **Market-creation side strategy** — Delphi is permissionless; analysts can mint high-edge subjective markets the mesh is uniquely positioned to price.

## Repository layout

Pythia is a **single flat monorepo**. Eight Python packages live under `packages/`, each independently pip-installable but designed to work together.

| Package | Import name | Role | Wraps |
|---|---|---|---|
| [`packages/delphi-adapter`](./packages/delphi-adapter) | `pythia_delphi_adapter` | ATT client, market metadata, settlement listener, config schema | **NEW** |
| [`packages/analyst-mesh`](./packages/analyst-mesh) | `pythia_analyst_mesh` | Base analyst agent + politics/crypto/sports/niche specialists + ensemble config | NEW |
| [`packages/consensus`](./packages/consensus) | `pythia_consensus` | Estimate fusion + agreement gate | `consensus-hardening-protocol` |
| [`packages/risk`](./packages/risk) | `pythia_risk` | Kelly sizing, exposure limits, drawdown brakes | `meshcfo` |
| [`packages/executor`](./packages/executor) | `pythia_executor` | Trade orchestration CLI → ATT | `metabocommand` |
| [`packages/observability`](./packages/observability) | `pythia_observability` | Audit trail, replay UI, P&L milestones | `agent-observability` + `achievements` |
| [`packages/forge`](./packages/forge) | `pythia_forge` | Backtest harness for resolved Delphi markets | `forge` |
| [`packages/strata`](./packages/strata) | `pythia_strata` | Stratified ingestion: Delphi feed, news, on-chain, social | `strata` |

> The wrapper packages (`consensus`, `risk`, `executor`, `observability`, `forge`, `strata`) are *thin* — they pin a version of the upstream `icohangar-ops` repo and add a Delphi-specific configuration layer. The upstream code stays the source of truth.

## Quickstart

### Prerequisites

- Python ≥ 3.11
- Node ≥ 20 (for the Gensyn ATT / `gensyn-delphi-skills` JS bindings)
- A Delphi account + API key (set as `DELPHI_API_KEY`)
- An LLM provider key for the analyst mesh (OpenAI / Anthropic / etc — set as `LLM_API_KEY`)

### Install (monorepo, dev mode)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/icohangar-ops/pythia.git
cd pythia
make install          # pip install -e each package in dependency order
make check            # verify env, ATT connectivity, LLM key
```

### Run a paper trade

```bash
pythia executor delphi paper-trade \
  --market <market-id> \
  --analysts politics,crypto,niche \
  --consensus-threshold 0.65 \
  --max-stake-usd 50
```

### Run live (small size)

```bash
pythia executor delphi run \
  --config configs/live-mvp.toml \
  --risk-max-drawdown-pct 5 \
  --log-level info
```

### Backtest on resolved markets

```bash
pythia forge backtest \
  --strategy configs/strategies/ensemble-v1.toml \
  --markets resolved-2025-Q4.json \
  --starting-capital 1000
```

---

## Configuration

All runtime config lives in `configs/`. The canonical MVP config is [`configs/live-mvp.toml`](./configs/live-mvp.toml):

```toml
[delphi]
api_key_env = "DELPHI_API_KEY"
endpoint = "https://api.delphi.gensyn.ai"
poll_interval_sec = 60

[mesh]
analysts = ["politics", "crypto", "sports", "niche"]
llm_provider = "openai"
llm_model = "gpt-4o-mini"
llm_api_key_env = "LLM_API_KEY"

[consensus]
method = "logit-mean"        # alternatives: "median", "trimmed-mean"
agreement_threshold = 0.65   # gating: skip trade if < threshold
min_analysts = 2             # need at least this many to even consider

[risk]
sizing = "kelly-fractional"
kelly_fraction = 0.25        # quarter-Kelly for safety
max_stake_per_market_usd = 50
max_total_exposure_usd = 500
max_drawdown_pct = 5
cool_down_min_after_loss = 30

[executor]
mode = "paper"               # "paper" | "live"
signing_key_env = "DELPHI_SIGNING_KEY"

[observability]
audit_log_path = "./logs/audit.jsonl"
replay_ui_port = 8088
achievements_enabled = true
```

## Roadmap

Pythia is shipped as an opinionated reference mesh plus thin integration wrappers around the upstream `icohangar-ops` repos. The suggested path from clean clone to live trading is roughly two engineering weeks for a solo operator familiar with the Delphi SDK.

| Phase | Milestone |
|---|---|
| 1 | Wire `packages/delphi-adapter` to `@gensyn-ai/gensyn-delphi-sdk`. Single market read + paper trade. |
| 2 | Stand up 3-analyst mesh (politics + crypto + niche) on `packages/strata` → `packages/consensus`. |
| 3 | Plug `packages/risk` (Kelly-capped sizing) + `packages/executor`. Go live with small size. |
| 4 | Iterate: tune agreement threshold, add sports analyst, run `packages/forge` backtests on resolved markets. |
| 5 | Polish `packages/observability` replay UI + `achievements` P&L milestones. |

## Propagation notes (wave B — DeFi/OnChain rows)

Adoption state for the portfolio propagation matrix rows that name this
repository. Adopted patterns name their implementing module; reversals name
the inspected module and the condition that would reopen the row.

| Row | Pattern | Outcome | Where / why |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Swarm consensus split damping | Adopted | `packages/consensus/src/pythia_consensus/fusion.py` — canonical chp-core-rs v0.1.0 `evaluate_swarm_gate` port: gap-based split detection over sorted analyst probabilities (`split_damped_weights`, `weighted_median_value`), side-size weight damping, and refusion on the damped weights. The trigger is `ConsensusConfig.split_threshold_pct` (default 20% of the weighted median with at least two votes on each side); `ConsensusDecision.split_damped` records when damping fired. |
| 5 | Deterministic governor | Adopted | `packages/consensus/src/pythia_consensus/fusion.py` excludes parse-fallback estimates — marked `degraded=True` by `packages/analyst-mesh/src/pythia_analyst_mesh/base.py` — from fusion (`ConsensusDecision.governor_excluded`) and refuses to trade (`skip`, P=0.5) when every ballot is degraded. Two unparseable LLM outputs can no longer fuse into perfect agreement. |
| 3 | Tiered resolution | Reversed | `packages/strata/src/pythia_strata/providers/news.py`, `onchain.py`, and `social.py` are declared stubs whose `fetch` performs no external reads, so there is nothing to tier. Reopen when a provider makes real network reads — the row then applies subject to its own conditions (a free/fast/always-up API leaves tiers 2–3 dead weight; headless surfaces gain no badge value) and via the canonical `cubiczan_resilience.tiered` module, never a second package. |
| 11 | On-chain identity + blob state | Reversed | `packages/consensus/src/pythia_consensus/audit.py` signs with a `stub:sha256:<hex>` fallback and the repo holds no Walrus or other blob state. Reopen once real signing exists and durable blob state arrives on the current stack — a Walrus port or an IPFS/Walrus-on-other-VM equivalent per the review's porting note. |

## License

MIT for the new code (`packages/delphi-adapter`, `packages/analyst-mesh`). Wrapper packages inherit the license of their upstream `icohangar-ops` repo.

## Status

| Component | Status |
|---|---|
| `packages/delphi-adapter` | SDK bridge client + market models + settlement listener |
| `packages/analyst-mesh` | 4 specialist analysts + registry + concurrent runner |
| `packages/consensus` | Logit-mean fusion + agreement gate + audit signer |
| `packages/risk` | Multi-outcome Kelly sizing + drawdown breaker + market-type rules |
| `packages/executor` | Full pipeline CLI (paper / live) + signing |
| `packages/observability` | Audit log reader + FastAPI replay UI + achievements |
| `packages/forge` | Backtester + report generator + tune CLI |
| `packages/strata` | News + on-chain + social enrichment providers |
| Design doc PDF | [`docs/pythia-design.pdf`](./docs/pythia-design.pdf) |

The upstream `icohangar-ops` repos (consensus-hardening-protocol, meshcfo, metabocommand, agent-observability, achievements, forge, strata) remain the source of truth for the wrapped concerns. Wire them under `packages/*/vendor/` (vendored + pinned) or as git submodules before going live with real capital.
